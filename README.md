This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the missing or incorrect CMD instruction. The initial Dockerfile (Dockerfile) lacks a proper command to run the application after the dependencies are installed.  The corrected Dockerfile (DockerfileFixed) shows how to fix this issue. The application itself is a simple Python script that prints a message.
